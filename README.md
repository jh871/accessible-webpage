# Accessible webpage

## EdX Bootcamp: Module 1 Challenge  
Original source code for task found at https://github.com/skills-bootcamp/frontend-dev (private repo)

----
## Description
This repository contains the materials for a webpage for a marketing company. The goal of the challenge set for the module was to adapt the preexisting HTML and CSS files to make them more accessible.

----
## Accessiblity
For the HTML file accessibility was improved through adding alt text to pictures and replacing non-semantic HTML tags with semantic tags. 

For the corresponding CSS file, the structure was changed to make it more concise, logically ordered and easier to read. 

Comments have also been added to the CSS file that aim to support readability of the code. The comments are descriptive of the different sections of the code and explain the purpose for each section as well as an overview of where each piece fits into the page, and how it should look e.g. by describing the colours.

This not only makes the CSS more readable but also means in future, if edits were made to the CSS file that caused elements to move around or change erronously, the developer can refer to the comments for an idea of how each section should work.

-----
## Usage
The webpage can be accessed by clicking the link to the deployed webpage, and is expected to work on any browser.

## Issues I had with this challenge
In the CSS file, some of the styling for different elements is the same, but the elements each have individual class names. I tried to change this so that elements that shared properties shared a class name but CSS failed, so I reverted to the original class names and consolidated them around their shared properties.

Another issue is the page is not very responsive to the browser window being dragged out of shape, for example the text will spill over other sections of background.
